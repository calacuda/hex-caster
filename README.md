# Hex-Caster

I like a streamdeck but more magical.

HexCaster is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. It allows the user to draw symbols on a [FrameWork Computers Trackpad](https://frame.work/products/touchpad-kit?v=FRANFT0001) to launch a coresponding keyboard shorcuts or run a script on the computer.
