# Hex-Caster

It's like a streamdeck but more magical.

HexCaster is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. It allows the user to draw symbols on a [Framework Laptop 13 Trackpad](https://frame.work/products/touchpad-kit?v=FRANFT0001) to either

- launch coresponding keyboard shorcuts or,
- run a script on the computer.
